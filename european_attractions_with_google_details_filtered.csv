Especially considering the price you pay to get in.\n\nIt would be nice if they had two ticket options: one for touring only the grounds and another for going inside. Walking around the terrace and exterior was the best part for us. The interior is similar to any other castle or palace in Europe from around that time period.\n\nAs for getting there, we parked at one of the train stations at the bottom of the hill. While eating lunch, we asked the server the best way to get to the palace and were told to take the city bus. When we got to the bus stop, there was a giant line of people in the queue. We priced out a Bolt and saw that it was only 1‚Ç¨ more than the bus for our family of six, so we went with that option. At the top, someone scanned our tickets to let us into the grounds (our tickets were scanned three more times before we actually made it inside the palace). By the time we were done, it was nearly closing time, and taxis lined up outside were eager to get any business since they were heading downhill anyway, so we were able to get a taxi down for the same price using Bolt.\n\nThe terrace and walkway around the exterior were truly the best part of our experience there.

Visiting castle with a tour guide or paying for audio guide is a good idea since you would be missing a lot of context.', 'Beautiful castle that‚Äôs full of loads of very interesting history.

The observatory is set up nicely. Ticket prices are really reasonable and value for money. Highly recommend a visit.', ""Awesome experience, as in truly awe inspiring. Despite the night being a bit cloudy we managed to spot several planets, a bunch of constellations and several shooting stars. The resident astronomer was very informative and fun. Answered any questions there were and even helped us take some pictures with our phone through the telescope. An experience we won't soon forget."", 'Great experience learning about space and seeing stars, planets and nebulas!', 'Was a great star gazing experience with Dark Sky team. Attended the Solar observatory session and it was amazing to see the surface of the sun and the prominences, flairs that erupt from its surface. It was combination of theory and telescopic observation at the same time. The night star gazing session was especially spectacular! You get to see the Milky way galaxy and the constalations, Jupiter and Sanitarium very Cleary with naked eye and impressive views from the telescopes. This place in Europe has very less light noise which makes it a fantastic experience to see the sky and stars like you never had before! The astronaut guide Nun was very knowledgeable, and made the sessions very entertaining! Special thanks to Rebecca who organized the tour and Carolina the photographer!

And hiking sticks to help you through the steep portions of your route. Once up at the bridge, the view towards Weisshorn is magnificent. The crossing is uneventful unless you are afraid of heights or there is a lot of wind, and you should definitely avoid the whole hiking projecct if there are thuderstorms in the area. The hike downhill on the opposite side does not present any difficulties, unless you have bad knees. Never do this trip without good mountain shoes. Once down, there are a couple of places for a well deserved beer.', 'Started at Randa Station from Zermatt. It was an uphill climb right from the start. Not an easy hike if you are not used to hiking and require some level of fitness to keep going up. Took me about 90mins to reach the bridge and it was breathtaking and exhilarating.

We paid for the beer tasting experience which again was excellent as part of our time there and referring to people in my group who would not usually partake in a beer, even they found the value for the money.  There are photo opportunities also so I was thrilled to come home with a personalised souvenir.  I would certainly go again and would highly recommend.', 'A great experience.

Once you get upstairs, they‚Äôll give you a tablet and it becomes an interactive experience. There are QR codes all over the museum that you scan, and you can watch videos/hear audio about the history of beer. I would say the coolest exhibit is the globe. You can scan various countries and learn about the history of beer from those regions.\n\nIt took us about a hour to see pretty much everything we wanted but if you want to go at a more leisurely pace, or if you‚Äôre super into beer, you could spend 1.5 to 2 hours here. Afterwards, you can head to the tasting room (if you booked that addition) and they give you 4 tokens for a tasting. My favorite beer was the Rodenbach Fruitage, which was a nice and crisp raspberry beer. They also have snacks for purchase, but we were saving our stomachs for an actual lunch.\n\nIt's definitely worth a visit when you‚Äôre in Bruges.

One of the unique features of this church is its extensive collection of artworks, including more than 200 paintings and numerous sculptures.\nThe church is particularly renowned for its collection of paintings by the Flemish Baroque artist Peter Paul Rubens. While many people associate Rubens with the Cathedral of Our Lady, he also made significant contributions to the artistic heritage of Sint-Pauluskerk. Inside the church, visitors can find several paintings attributed to or inspired by Rubens, including ""The Conversion of Saint Paul"" and ""The Assumption of the Virgin.""\nIn addition to Rubens\' works, Sint-Pauluskerk houses paintings by other renowned artists such as Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, and Cornelis de Vos. These artworks depict biblical scenes, saints, and religious iconography, showcasing the rich artistic tradition of the region during the Baroque period.\nAside from the impressive collection of paintings, the church\'s interior boasts stunning architectural elements, intricate woodwork, and beautiful stained glass windows.

There is approximately 200m of walking up a slighty inclined service road from the car park.\n\nThe tour was in Spanish only, which is ok if you can pick up a few words here and there. Even if not it‚Äôs pretty obvious when the guide shines a light on a handprint or artwork.\n\nSeeing these original artworks from over 10,000 years ago is simply phenomenal. Other caves have replicas, but this is the real deal.\n\nDefinitely book ahead to avoid disappointment, and make sure you check in at the visitor centre at the bottom of the hill.', 'The guided tour this morning at 10:05 was simply amazing. Our guide - Spanish speaking gentleman - did speak slowly and hence with our 4 yrs Spanish on Duolingo we understood everything. His - the guide - passion for the subject came clearly through to all 6 of us and it was an really great 1 hour there.\n\nWe loved it! Hard to imagine our ancestors lived there already 150.000 yrs ago! What an incredible piece of history.\n\nCouple of tips:\n- the ticket office is directly to the left after the village. It‚Äôs easily missed and for tickets you need to be there.\n- if you have booked online, they will let you in on the top of the hill too.\n- try to pre-book online as the experience is incredible and it gets sold out quickly in popular times.\n- The whole reservation page is in Spanish - again with our 4 yrs on Duolingo - manageable.  It took us about 30 min to get the reservation.\n- get coffee or sandwiches before or afterwards  in the cafeteria El Parque in the village. They are both super delicious and it‚Äôs very relaxed / part  if the grand hotel Puente Viesgo.

It‚Äôs a true home where you can feel less madness of Dali but more everyday life of the artist and his wife. They lived here and it‚Äôs obvious. But you can still see his amazing flair and talent. However the system to buy and get the tickets is weird. Even if you buy it online (which i strongly recommend) you have to arrive 30 mins in advance to pick them up and wait for 30 mins to start the visit which doesn‚Äôt make any sense. We were here in winter and there were no places to stay a bit and drink coffee or have any snacks. 30 mins of walking around is not so cool. Meanwhile the museum itself is worth it. It‚Äôs the third spot out of three museums within the Dal√≠ triangle.

She was a bit more polite later, telling me to enjoy the collection, but I just don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù why she started out by saying it wasn‚Äôt open.

The signs describing some of the artifacts were only in Spanish, so I had to use google translate. Nevertheless, this place was so worth the visit if you‚Äôre in Toledo!!', 'Shame. Extremely disappointed with the staff. Visited the museum and noticed a young man who hid a ""Palestine"" sticker under his coat, then took taunting photos with his friends in front of the exhibited artifacts from the expelled Sephardic Jewish community this museum focuses on. I found it unbelievably disrespectful: I would never go to a Muslim Community museum with an Israel shirt and take ""F You"" photos to taunt and disrespect that community. Note there is NOTHING in the museum about Israel or Palestine or the conflict in the middle east so this behavior was directly targeting Jews, which was offensive to me as a Jewish person who came to Toledo and this museum in particular to connect to the rich heritage and history of my people.\n\nWhen alerting a member of the staff (who hardly spoke English) to this, they said ""this is okay, I don\'t see an issue"". A second staff member (who also hardly spoke English) repeated the same thing, adding ""this isn\'t a problem because it\'s a museum and not a synagogue"". What?! Again, I dare any decent person to try this in a Muslim Community museum. I talked to another member of the staff (who didn\'t speak English at all) who said I should wait so I can complain officially. After several minutes they went away to look for either the young man or the first staff member so I could confront them (I am guessing, they didn\'t really explain what was happening). I was not going to stay and argue using Google Translate having already spent 15 minutes trying to explain myself to insensitive staff members. I left, upset and distraught.\n\nThis to me was a low point in my trip and extremely discouraging and disappointing to experience from the staff of a museum which in my opinion is supposed to treat its subjects with some level of honor. I am ashamed and offended, the people running the museum should not be in charge if they can\'t find the fault in this situation. I will never set foot there again.', 'An amazing building. Part of the synagogue has preserved it\'s Hebrew and Arabic original decoration. It was a bit bittersweet the story of ""The Keys of the Sephardim"" that appears in the picture I have shared.\nLong time ago, the rulers of Spain and Portugal banned Judaism and the Sephardic diaspora started. The ones that remained suffered continual threats by the Catholic Inquisition, a very aggressive legal system and public humiliation. Those Crypto-Jews received the pejorative nickname ""marrano"", that means ""pig"". They are the ancestors of the Bnei Anusim\xa0(Hebrew:\xa0◊ë◊†◊ô ◊ê◊†◊ï◊°◊ô◊ù ◊°◊§◊®◊ì◊ô◊ô◊ù, ""Children of the coerced""). The ones that escaped the Iberian Peninsula brought with them the keys of the houses, with the hope that one day they will be back home in Spain and Portugal. Centuries later, some Sephardic descents, by joining Zionism and its Ashkenormativity, made the same crime to Palestinians during the 1948 events, when thousands of Palestinians suffered a similar forced displacement by IDF under the command of David Ben Guirion. That is why the üóùÔ∏è is one of the symbols of resistance in Palestine. History is, again, repeating itself. And that makes me feel deeply disappointed.', ""So I'm Jewish and from Israel too. I gather by meeting other tourists that we all think it's heart warming to see the people you are affiliated with in such a place together abroad as a place of gathering, for strangers from different lands. But the synagogue rich as it may be in history and culture, doesn't have as much dignity as the churches do (oh boy do the churches look astonishing). The synagogue seemed underwhelming, also the video and representation of judaism seemed so 'back in the day' and not what modern day Judaism looks like.

I finally had the chance to visit the site and I didn\'t waste my time. The scene that was recorded here, from the movie ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", is one of the most iconic in cinema, and being able to be in the exact same place where Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef recorded the famous mexican standoff, was great. The site was brought back to life, by the Asociaci√≥n Cultural Sad Hill, after 50 years of abandonment. And what a great job they\'ve done!!! Upon arrival, next to the fence, there is plenty of parking and it is free. The last 4km of the path are on a dirt road.

The track is accessible by any type of car, no 4x4 necessary, although the route is not ideal for inexperienced or nervous drivers. There is a steep ascent and then a steep descent before the car park is reached. This all takes about 15 to 20 minutes. It is recommendable to drive dead slow, due to the poor state of the dirt track. A very short walk leads to the ""cemetery"" of Sad Hill, which has been restored to something approaching its original state by fans and volunteers, many of whom are locals from the surrounding villages.\nThe location is also accessible from the village of Contreras, again via a narrow dirt track but this takes longer, a good 25 minutes.\nA truly remarkable experience for anybody who is a fan of Sergio Leone\'s work, Clint Eastwood and westerns in general.', ""one magical place...the best half an hour of movie history were made here and as movie and italowestern lover this place have to be on every bucket list!

We drove there and what a fun filled drive it was, basically just a dirt track, but the view from above a you come round the bend is amazing.\nOnce down in the valley and walking round the cemetery looking for Arch Stanton, it's breath taking.

Its vaults are decorated in the baroque style of the 17th century, in the shape of lunettes.

We despite choosing a less crowded period in Venice and purchasing tickets in advance with a specific time slot, the palace was still crowded. This can only mean they are selling too many tickets without considering visitors' experience.\n\nThe first and longest part of your visit is a dull exhibition about the palace and the Venetian dukes. If you know nothing about Venice Palace and Dukes, the exhibition might be interesting, but if you have even a bit of knowledge, it will feel boring. The rooms they prepared for this exhibition are specially designed to close off the palace, with walls covered in burgundy plaster and ceilings covered with nets, giving no sense of being inside a palace. We thought the whole visit would be like this, and we felt disappointed.\n\nIn the second part, you get to see the grand palace rooms and halls. The rooms are truly beautiful with their magnificent ceilings and walls adorned with paintings.\n\nThe third part involves visiting the prison by crossing the Bridge of Sighs. It's an empty and boring walk. You only see prison cells.\n\nIn short, you pay an exorbitant fee to see a few rooms and halls of the palace amidst a crowded mass of people. I definitely don't think it's worth it."", 'A truly amazing building. The large rooms filled with paintings and gold leaf are breathtaking. Paintings by some true greats including Titian. The tour around the building has lots of information to guide you through how the palace was used and what the Doge was. Then the journey takes you to the prison part of the building (including crossing the bridge of sighs.) This section is very different but equally fascinating. You get a proper look in all the cells and the long creepy corridors are very atmospheric (we chose the longer route around the prison, and we definitely feel like that was the better option for a more in-depth look.)\nThe tickets are expensive (‚Ç¨30 each if you buy on the day) but it‚Äôs clear that the money is being spent on constant restoration work and maintaining the incredible art and architecture. We queued up on the day for tickets and only queued for 5 minutes - this was in early January though so I would recommend buying in advance if you‚Äôre visiting later in the year.\nThere is a cafe but everything was very expensive even compared to the prices in the rest of San Marco‚Äôs square, so we didn‚Äôt end up buying anything there.\nThere was the option to pay extra for an audio guide but we opted to read the information boards for free and still felt that we learnt a great deal around the palace.\nOverall an amazing excursion - do leave a good few hours to get around everything with plenty of time to read the information and take your time looking at the artwork.', 'The queue wasn‚Äôt very long (we went there at 3pm on a Wednesday) but it was extremely crowded inside, we basically followed a line of people from start to finish and the whole experience lasted about 90 minutes. Despite all this it was still enjoyable and the architectural details, the painting and ceilings were stunning. I highly recommend buying tickets online a few weeks in advance. We overheard several people saying they wouldn‚Äôt be able to go inside because they weren‚Äôt selling any more tickets.', ""Visiting Doge's Palace in Venice was an absolute delight!

So just enjoy seeing the towers as you walk by at street level for now."", 'We went to this landmark earlier in the year and the view at the top was amazing. It is the highest point you can get to in the city; you can see around for miles. However it does take a while to go up the many, many stairs - as there is only one staircase to go up and down. I would recommend this if you have lots of time in Bologna and are not afraid of heights!', 'Unfortunately the towers have recently been closed due to safety reasons. So now you can only admire from the street. They are beautiful though and hopefully they can be restored so people can walk up them again. They are fun though and are slightly leaning. Great view from the street.', ""The\xa0Two Towers\xa0(Italian:\xa0Le due torri), both leaning, are symbols of\xa0Bologna, Italy,[1]\xa0and the most prominent of the\xa0Towers of Bologna. They are located at the intersection of the roads that lead to the five gates of the old ring wall (mura dei torresotti). The taller one is called the\xa0Asinelli. The smaller tower with a greater lean is called the\xa0Garisenda. Their names derive from the families which are traditionally credited with having constructed the towers between 1109 and 1119.\n\nTheir construction may have been a competition between the two families to show which was the more powerful family.[3][4]\xa0The scarcity of documents from this early period makes this uncertain. The name of the Asinelli family, for example, is documented for the first time in 1185, almost 70 years after the presumed construction of the tower which is attributed to them.\n\nAsinelli Tower\n\nÔøºInside the Asinelli Tower\n\nIt is believed that the Asinelli Tower initially had a height of ca. 70 metres (230 feet) and was raised later to the current 97.2 metres (319\xa0ft), with an overhanging battlement of 2.2 m (6.6 ft). In the 14th century the city became its owner and used it as a prison and small stronghold.\n\nDuring this period a wooden construction was added around the tower at a height of roughly 30 metres, about 100 feet, above ground, which was connected with an aerial footbridge to the Garisenda Tower. The footbridge was destroyed in a 1398 fire. Its addition is attributed to\xa0Giovanni Visconti,\xa0Duke of Milan, who allegedly wanted to use it to control the turbulent\xa0Mercato di Mezzo, the central street, today the via Rizzoli, to suppress possible revolts. The\xa0Visconti\xa0had become the rulers of Bologna after the decline of the\xa0Signoria\xa0of the\xa0Pepoli\xa0family, but were rather unpopular in the city.\n\nSevere damage was caused by lightning that often resulted in small fires and collapses. In 1824 a\xa0lightning rod\xa0was installed. The tower has survived at least two documented large fires: the first in 1185 was due to\xa0arson\xa0and a second one in 1398.\n\nThe Asinelli Tower was used by the scientists\xa0Giovanni Battista Riccioli\xa0in 1640 and\xa0Giovanni Battista Guglielmini\xa0in the 1700s for experiments to study the motion of\xa0heavy bodies\xa0and the\xa0Earth's rotation. In\xa0World War II, between 1943 and 1945, it was used as a sight post: During bombing attacks, four volunteers took post at the top to direct rescue operations, to places hit by\xa0Allied\xa0bombs. Later, a\xa0RAI\xa0television relay was installed on top.\n\nGarisenda Tower\n\nÔøºA view of Torre della Garisenda and Chiesa dei Santi Bartolomeo e Gaetano from Torre degli Asinelli\n\nThe Garisenda Tower today has a height of 48 metres (157 feet), with an overhang of 3.2 metres (10\xa0ft). Initially, it was approximately 60 metres (about 200 feet) high, but had to be lowered in the 14th century due to a yielding of the ground which left it slanting and dangerous.[5]\xa0In the early 15th century, the tower was bought by the\xa0Arte dei Drappieri, which remained the sole owner until the\xa0Garisenda\xa0became municipal property at the end of the 19th century.\n\nIt was cited several times by\xa0Dante\xa0in the\xa0Divine Comedy\xa0and\xa0The Rhymes, a confirmation of his stay in Bologna,[1]\xa0and by\xa0Goethe\xa0in his\xa0Italian Journey. The Two Towers were the subject of an\xa0eponymous\xa0poem by\xa0Giosu√® Carducci\xa0as part of the\xa0Barbarian Odes. Charles Dickens wrote about the towers in his\xa0Pictures from Italy.[6]\xa0Antal Szerb\xa0wrote about them in\xa0The Third Tower: Journeys in Italy.[7]\n\nIn October 2023, the tower was sealed off by the city of Bologna after fears the structure was tilting too far.[8]\xa0Bologna officials noted that the tower has leaned since it was built ‚Äúand has been a concern ever since.‚Äù It sustained additional damage in the medieval era when ironwork and bakery ovens were built inside.[9]\xa0The tower is monitored for cracks. Sensors have been installed to track any shifting.\n\nOn 2 December 2023, the city announced the situation was critical, and the tower could collapse. The city began constructing a 5 metre tall barrier to contain the debris in the event of a fall."", 'Really enjoyed this. For ‚Ç¨5 you can‚Äôt beat it.\nI did the 10am (first) entry. Was super quick. In and out in 20 minutes. Definitely not accessible.\nI think the first tour is the best because the stairs are narrow and you have people traversing both ways. Whereas the first tour you go up and no one is attempting to come down. Look through the holes in the stone - they are great view points from the stairs.\nBuy tickets online in advance - they limit the amount of people every 15 minutes.']",https://www.bolognawelcome.com/it/esperienze/112542/Le-due-Torri---Prenotazione-salita-alla-Torre-degli-Asinelli,N/A,ATplDJaJsXQQHdjJQfLe2TLY19CSAvgT1Bdh-UFqMAelbRXC4DPXTLLI8zqxWC66w6Zumna_R0d6Isi-gJpoqtD8jdugGHzcD7lAq_5U60Exl71aBVYC3hbqaZ7GP6fnPtTw6g9xFCEzIBMwvbRV6HrAzrpKGtmgAdIKT7if22oBpAzrCxkn,12032.0,9024.0,ATplDJY1Pw4rWsF4quCuzolA1LfnRmpzg5LxouTA8iPUt7LotlBQVeVwdo9URuEf43eCplNxSf05epbX6KIv2dL_K2m0mQlfsuug-YF0HV2lLm7k7qdwpPtCiy_TpTCwY0oe5-M9DKvzk_FIjEza2GTEb8iK4hHdbJkTJUnqIOGGg1VIb_wn,2492.0,1609.0,ATplDJb_6NkBla1QQj8HT2r8uaDD-VNcpZB8o-fp5tmJPECip3RxXxXEuvd36yEKlxP4s2BgWaZgGquCR3djBAPuUK-gW_x5CBfzP06_wFYz1WsVRzZaEnkeA8VMIyk6dtmtqN3_oupILvvEzvMwO6wUV3GTyVRtn47LNiQTSE9lIax9cAL8,4032.0,3024.0,ATplDJateYNsuY_41r-w9ffLLvMYxHFdqo3EIxgtTkpLM0AyjVeqPS4GbiHgM4PQN66RBdAzeyI2bVodLMYRcxHpUWofi5ZIfz6a3XJmkMCM_xv4-IAjob0NtcRewVA96fbBygQaTYNSqLXYKdfY4ab0XDIaOMP2htAqB0bCYVYUJ2_2Z7A,3000.0,4000.0,ATplDJZ9OJ3sX1CWwHLnzhLvNkPXfM_5ThCJKzqkgyrcHo67JzPGmF8KR2g7-IqceH5T_sNvtdZlJHtOe2hIk9siqh4j2KxbkFc4fTmDsJJ4JwqZlzHumijyXkf2DdVdwvf-KpCEXLD6tiShxGzw2lIE3vuz1rgETYPkeKRQfbdqkHPKu_g0,2160.0,3840.0,Italy

The ticket office is located in the town center a few steps from the access to the first bridge.  The attraction is in fact represented by two Tibetan steel bridges.  The first about 100 meters long leads to the opposite side of a wide valley.  Once you arrive on this side, you take an uphill path that leads to the second bridge, the bridge to the moon, about 300 meters long and at a greater height than the first.  The second bridge also, compared to the first, provides a slightly downhill stretch at the beginning and an uphill stretch at the end.  The view is very beautiful and can be enjoyed if you are lucky enough to cross the bridge in a day with few tourists and above all with little wind.In any case, both bridges swing quite a bit and you have to cross them carefully and always putting your foot on the  center of the steel step to avoid further swaying.  I strongly advise against those who suffer from dizziness or have problems with balance or in any case not in good physical shape or overweight. The staff does not carry out a safety briefing but merely harnesses you and provides you with the essential information for crossing bridges.  during the passage on the bridges it is necessary to release the safety carabiners to go beyond the supports of the bridge and I believe it is necessary to communicate more information to the tourist and possibly the behavior to be followed in an emergency, since in my opinion it is in any case an activity that can involve  dangers for unfamiliar people or people not used to using this type of equipment.  the cost of the ticket is currently 15 euros.

The cove is easily accessible via the stairs leading down to the stoney beach. You can navigate to this area by walking along the road or taking the bus, but there are small spaces for scooters to park on the side of the road. However, navigating via bus proves to have its own difficulties and the spaces are not 'designated'.\n\nThe cove itself is stunning but if the sea is rough and the sun is not directly shining down, it is not somewhere where you could spend a day. There are no facilities such as toilets or shops, so I would recommend bringing your own food and drink.\n\nWe visited at the start of the season which meant the beach was not crowded, but, I could imagine it becoming a hectic experience if you came at the height of the season.

He spoke clearly and articulately and helped the boys understand the significance of what the gladiators meant for Romans of the time.\n\nI didn‚Äôt look to attend myself, as I was simply going to watch, but Mirko insisted that I join in and help the boys make good memories. I‚Äôm glad that I did.\n\nThe class goes for just over 2 hours and covers some light history, some mild warm up exercises, before moving into sword training and hand-to-hand combat.\n\nThis is a must-do event in Rome with kids. It‚Äôs well worth the price, especially if you ask for Mirko as your instructor!\n\nThanks for making this a wonderful event for the kids. They will never forget it!', 'This place was a major highlight of our trip to Italy. First we got a tour of the museum where adults and kids got to try on armor and handle weapons. Then we went to the training area where we started with some exercises before being taught some basic attacking and defensive moves using wooden swords. Finally, we fought in various battles using real shields and padded weapons in their arena in front of a parent who‚Äôd volunteered to be the emperor. The instructor was good natured and we felt safe. Just a slight word of warning-we were there in June and and there were mosquitoes, so bring some bug spray.

While I think this is her greatest asset as a person, it has, at times, become her greatest weakness as well.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to sports, she is hesitant and doesn't engage as much as even she wishes she could. We've tried many different ways for her to get more assertive to no avail.\n\nBut 1 and a half hours into gladiator training, we saw a different side of her. We saw a strong warrior ready to take on all comers with an aggressive smile that made our hearts melt.\n\nThis barren, desolate place lacks what the big, touristy places have, and 99% of people who come to Rome will miss it.

The play of light on the transparent surfaces creates a mesmerizing dance, casting colorful reflections that enchant the onlookers. The structure exudes an aura of sophistication and mystery, inviting visitors to explore its secrets within.\n\nStepping inside, you are greeted by an abundance of natural light flooding the interior, giving the space an ethereal quality.

Every corner of the Glass Pyramid seems to have been meticulously planned, from the placement of art installations to the choice of ambient lighting. It's a space where art, architecture, and nature harmoniously coexist.\n\nBeyond its visual appeal, the Glass Pyramid also serves as a testament to sustainable architecture.

Concerts, art exhibitions, and lectures find a natural home within its transparent walls. The acoustics are flawless, enhancing the auditory experience for music enthusiasts and ensuring that every note resonates beautifully within the space.\n\nIn conclusion, the Glass Pyramid is more than just a feat of architectural brilliance; it's a testament to human creativity and ingenuity. It invites visitors to explore the intersection of art, nature, and technology, leaving them with a sense of wonder and admiration.

It was incredibly disheartening to see our property treated with such neglect and then have the blame shifted onto us. The lack of professionalism and accountability was staggering.\n\nTo make matters worse, after arguing with the attendant about the damaged trailer, she decided to kick us out of the campsite altogether, claiming there was no room for us. It was obvious she wanted to wash their hands of the situation and leave us stranded in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThe whole experience left us feeling not only frustrated but also abandoned. Her actions were completely unacceptable, and I wouldn't wish this kind of treatment on anyone.\n\nNeedless to say, our much-anticipated camping trip turned into a nightmarish ordeal, and we left the campsite with our spirits shattered and our property damaged. I strongly advise anyone considering staying here to think twice and find a place where they prioritize customer service, responsibility, and common decency.\n\nI hope this review helps you share your unfortunate experience and holds the campsite accountable for their actions.

It's calm and we slept well at night in our tent - a big surprise for a four star camping. Some 4 star campings are really noisy because there are too many teenagers and children but in Ceyreste they evenly placed mobil homes and tents that gave a great balance of population. There's a source of water for every emplacement which is really a great advantage. The pools are big enough and refreshing and the slides are fun for children. The aire de jeux and chateau gonflable are also a great plus and other amenities like table tennis and aire de fitness. The animations are well varied and they end not too late in the evening. The restaurant needs to improve their pizzas. The only disadvantage is that the camping site has a tough route from the bus stop. We need to walk steeply uphill to go back home. After a day at the beach or activity it could really be tiring to hike uphill for 15 mins especially with children. Fortunately, there is a mini bus that connects the bus stop and goes uphill around 17h and 18h. This mini bus is provided by the region and not by the camping. We mentioned this good news to the receptionist so the others would also know but she had no idea about this mini bus and didn't even care as she stared to us blankly and unfriendly. The other staff however are friendly during the times we ask for other things.

Maisy Battery,49.3764133,-1.0611054,"Batterie de Maisy, Route des Perruques, Grandcamp-Maisy, Calvados 14450, France",ChIJpQ7zp0t1C0gRscxydmBkqW8,museum,https://maps.google.com/?cid=8046072574740974769,4.2,1357.0,"['Great bit of history. Little bit of water & mud on the paths which added to the experience for me. Lovely lady in the pay booth really helpful. (Plus she loved our Triumph motorcycles) Just go there!', ""A little gem of history in Normandy.\n\nWe found this place after looking on maps for somewhere to go for a visit and this place was awesome.\n\nWhen you pull into the carpark it doesn't look like much. A few guns on display and a unit that you can go in for some souvenirs, however when you pay to go and visit the site it all changes. After exiting the unit you then have free reign to walk about this old battle site. There was plenty to walk around and you can actually walk into the old bunkers and see it with your own eyes. Be careful though it's dark in there.\n\nIt's amazing to actually see something from the war that is still relatively kept together and they are still working to excavate more even now.\n\nIt's well worth the visit if your a history buff."", ""What a find! Meaning from both the point of view of Mr Sterne, who quite literally uncovered this site, & on mine and my husband's for getting there this trip. It's a place that's caused & is still causing, much theorising & controversy - so it was always on the to-do list, especially as we were staying 3 minutes down the road in Gefosse Fontenay.\n\nThe mystery surrounding the very existence & ultimate secrecy of the Maisy battery is still very much up in the air. But perhaps this layer of cover-up just goes to add to the overall 'vibe' and raw quality of the place, a quality that that is disappointingly missing from other sites such as Pointe du Hoc to name just one, now that access is 99% restricted & you're forced to follow the herd & take photos at designated spots only. It's the freedom, the untapped possibility, & the quiet reverence of Maisy that sets it apart.\n\nSo no, there are no mannequins here thank goodness! There are no disruptive audio displays or pristinely mocked-up rooms, no meddling or messing. Perhaps this is just me, but I feel that these cliches of the museum leg of the tourist trail just serve to detract from the location. They're great for an actual museum, brilliant, the more the merrier, but for the actual location.... not for me. You can't feel what's happened somewhere (and surely that's why you're there?) if all your senses are being ambushed by mock-ups & glossy, noisy displays. Maisy is the perfect example of beautiful rawness, & whilst the artefacts found there will at some point be on display in a museum, it's fantastic to explore the site in its current state.\n\nWe visited three times during the 79th anniversary of D-Day, & and (obviously) there was something that drew us back. Not only the unpolished tracks and explorable bunkers, but the friendly & welcoming staff too. Many thanks to Lorna & her lovely colleague! On our final trip the day we went home, we were allowed to observe a short but emotional ceremony, the 10th June being the 79th anniversary of the liberation of the battery.\n\nThanks to all for allowing access to such an important, fascinating & respectful location... we aim to be back!"", ""Great site to visit. If you like the manicured lawns of Merville or Crisbecq batteries, then you may not find the rugged grittiness of Maisy Battery to your taste. However,  if you're open to a more interesting adventure at a site that actually had guns on d-day, then Maisy is just the place. The site is being slowly excavated by a private family,  so don't expect a big corporate site. It gets muddy in the rain, so come prepared. Maisy also has a great little shop on site, selling both regular souvenirs and some great authentic items. If you're lucky, you might get to meet Emma, who works behind the counter. She is both extremely helpful and very knowledgeable. Allow 1.5 hours for your visit."", 'I visited Maisy Battery while on a trip to Normandy.  It was - by far - the best preserved battle site that I visited on my trip.  If you want to see renovated sites and batteries along the Atlantikwall, they are plentiful, but none will capture the historic feel as Maisy Battery. Gary has done an excellent job as preserving the site how it would have looked during the invasion, while adding small ‚Äúconveniences‚Äù to allow tourists to walk through the same trenches the Germans did.  There is also a fine collection of artifacts and weaponry near the start to walk around and touch.  The battery is well worth the admission price.  It is not handicap accessible and you won‚Äôt find concrete paths, so wear appropriate shoes as it can get a little dirty after a heavy rain. Gary is doing what he can to address the flooding issues, but keep in mind where you are and the experience you are getting from viewing this battery.  I hope that more elements of this battery are uncovered and that it only grows.  For now, it‚Äôs a must-hit item on your Normandy trip!
